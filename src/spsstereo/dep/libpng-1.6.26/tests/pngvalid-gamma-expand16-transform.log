Gamma correction error summary

The printed value is the maximum error in the pixel values
calculated by the libpng gamma correction code.  The error
is calculated as the difference between the output pixel
value (always an integer) and the ideal value from the
libpng specification (typically not an integer).

Expect this value to be less than .5 for 8 bit formats,
less than 1 for formats with fewer than 8 bits and a small
number (typically less than 5) for the 16 bit formats.
For performance reasons the value for 16 bit formats
increases when the image file includes an sBIT chunk.

Basic gamma correction:
  2 bit gray:  127.07023
  4 bit gray:  127.07023
  8 bit gray:  128.32752
  8 bit color: 128.32752
  indexed:     128.32752
 16 bit gray:  0.74080
 16 bit color: 0.74080
PASS: pngvalid --strict --gamma-transform --expand16 (floating point arithmetic)
